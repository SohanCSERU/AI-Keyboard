# A Artificial Intelligence based bangla Keyboard Mobile app 
## The RoadMap
- Create a Bangla Keyboard with **প্রভাত** layout  
- We create a classifier in Python using __TensorFlow__ and __Keras__.    
- Convert the Keras model to a __TensorFlow Lite__ model.  
- Convert the Keras’ __Tokenizer__ vocabulary to a JSON file.
-  **Padding** the texts as the model can only take int{1,199} size shape and **Float32**
- Load the TF Lite model and JSON file in Android.
- Perform inference on the model in the Android app.
